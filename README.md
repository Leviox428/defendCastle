# 🏰 Defend Castle

> A RTS 2D Wave defence game built with Java and JavaFX UI library.

---

## 🖼️ Overview

Defend Castle is a 2D wave defense strategy game where the player must gather resources, build, and upgrade structures to survive increasingly difficult enemy waves.

Players can construct and upgrade buildings such as barracks, woodmills, quarries, walls, and the castle itself.
Resource-generating buildings like the woodmill and quarry automatically produce materials over time, while others like the barracks allow the player to train units for defense.

Between each enemy wave, players have a limited preparation phase to fortify their defenses. When the attack begins, enemies spawn and assault the player’s castle — if the castle falls, the game ends.
